      <description>April 2018, 2 colleagues and I were sent to Oulu, Finland by MediaTek to have a 10-days co-working with the L1 people of the company&amp;rsquo;s branch in Finland. The team&amp;rsquo;s people are mostly former employees of Nokia. The subject was partition discussion of the new 5G modem project. We had a great time during the visit, knowing each other, discussing technical topics, exchanging thoughts, etc.. They are excellent engineers.
The Finland colleagues spoke frankly.</description>
