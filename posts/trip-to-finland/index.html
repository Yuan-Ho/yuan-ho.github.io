<p>April 2018, 2 colleagues and I were sent to Oulu, Finland by MediaTek to have a 10-days co-working with the L1 people of the company&rsquo;s branch in Finland. The team&rsquo;s people are mostly former employees of Nokia. The subject was partition discussion of the new 5G modem project. We had a great time during the visit, knowing each other, discussing technical topics, exchanging thoughts, etc.. They are excellent engineers.</p>

<p>The Finland colleagues spoke frankly. During the visit, we listened a lot to their complaints about the HQ (headquater) people. (For them, we are the HQ people). I learned that this is culture difference. In Taiwan, even if someone is really upset, he seldom speaks it out.</p>

<p>On the weekend, we went to Santa Claus Village at Rovaniemi, where I took the picture. It was a sled sliding pulled by Huskies. The sliding was fast and jolting. The dogs seemed really excited to have work to do. I also took a picture with the Santa. The Santa had smiley eyes and most of his face covered by beard.</p>

<p>We communicate with Finland co-workers by English. However, they have pecularities on pronouncing English words. For example, they read &ldquo;W&rdquo; in abbreviations as &ldquo;VV&rdquo;. So &ldquo;BWP&rdquo; is read as &ldquo;BVVP&rdquo; and &ldquo;AWV&rdquo; is read as &ldquo;AVV&rdquo; (the third V is omitted :O). It is really interesting to find out this kind of pecularity from people.</p>

<p>Anyway, the 10-days visit was full of surprise. After we came back, the following discussions and co-working with them went smoothly and the development turns out to be a success.</p>
