<p>July, 2019, the new building of MediaTek is completed and all software teams and some firmware teams of the cellular modem project are moving into it. The new building is only about 80 meters away from the previous one. This picture was taken right before moving. The job is the same, just new seat and office furnitures.</p>

<p>It is an amazing trip that I have the opprtunity to join the development from 2G to 5G modems. While doing 2G, I was a newbie and often drove my manager crazy by doing wrong things. For 3G, I was somewhat more experienced and the burden was so heavy that I came home at 11pm more or less, for several years. For 4G, my job became software performance optimization across teams, which means I need to look at someone else&rsquo;s code and give them advices. For 5G, what I often do is asking (begging) everybody to come to the meeting I host. If I don&rsquo;t ask, they will join the meeting using Webex (online meeting) from their seat and the meeting room will appear very empty.</p>

<p>Taiwanese government has banned the use of plastic straws so the staff cafeteria stopped providing them. Have to get used to it.</p>
